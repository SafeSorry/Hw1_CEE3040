# 2. (10 pts) It is getting cold in Ithaca and you have found your winter jacket from the depths of your closet. While
# checking your jacketâ€™s pockets, you find that there are some coins in one of them. You see that you have a
# penny, nickel, dime, quarter, loonie ($1 coin), and a toonie ($2 coin) (because you are Canadian). If you were
# to put these coins back in your pocket and draw 3 at a time, how many different monetary sums are possible?
# (For ex: draw a loonie, toonie, and a penny = $3.01) Use code to show your numerical solution.

# 4. (10 pts) Suppose you are planning a very cool block party with some of your house mates. You have 12 friends
# but you can only invite 7 of them. How many times will 3 particular friends always attend if you happen to

#To designate and select friends, I will treat them as a list of 12 integers, where each integer is a friend 
#and 7 must be selected to be "invited"

#I will then find all possible invite lists with permutations  of this list

#they attend by seeing how many times they appear throughout
